# Git workflow
##### a brief introduction to git workflow
## What is git?
According to wiki, we have this definition:
> Git (/ɡɪt/[7]) is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development,[8] but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

In my own words, git is a place where you can store your versions of code. 

It makes it possible for **anyone** to pick up from **any stage** of your project. 
It's just like a tree, whose brances are **new ideas** come out from exactly the **same** place!

##  Why do we love git workflow?

+ **Git** offers a lot of flexibility in how users manage changes. 

It stores the path you have gone through during the whole process of your project. In other words, it records the process how your project has changed.

+ You may save your current status with git and pick it up wherever you are.

you can save your undone job at workplace and continue with your PC at home!
+ It shows your team members where you are on your way to your target and how they may probably help you.

You may also gather new ideas from others to fix bugs and make your product better!
+ Moreover, it offers you the chance to regret!

If you want to regret, just go to git and get your old versions of your project!
